# Analyzing Flight-Booking Dataset

## About

If you ask me my subject of interest, I would answer, "Travel!" in a split second. I consider myself very fortunate, having traveled to 3 foreign countries and almost every state in India at the young age of 20. 

Exploring new places, learning about diverse cultures, and meeting new people offers me a sense of fulfillment and peace. It might come across to you as strange, but to me - it feels like home when I am far away. 

I noticed that while planning any trip, amidst the various tasks at hand, one stood out as particularly time-consuming and tedious â€“ the process of booking flights. I would spend hours searching for the cheapest flight, only to feel overwhelmed by the options and conflicting prices. Recognizing that, aside from accommodation, flights constitute a major expenditure in trip planning, I sought to unravel valuable insights. 

This exploratory data analysis primarily entailed descriptive analysis; a method characterized by the objective examination of the dataset's key attributes. Free from preconceived notions, the approach involved summarizing and delineating the dataset's core features. Employing a variety of techniques such as visualizations, and summary statistics, I aimed to unearth patterns, relationships, and intriguing features within the data. By organizing and presenting the data in a meaningful manner, this project aimed at understanding of factors influencing flight prices and empower travellers with the knowledge of making better decisions.
